In this assignment, we were both responsible for ensuring that we
understood the problem statement and what we needed to do.
Most of the time we were together and writing code together, so
it's hard to determine who contributed to what, but I helped
modularized the code once we got the core functions and
capabilities correct. I also helped with writing the test cases.

My teammate David, his experience with SQL came in handy once we
were trying to debug the wildcard characters, in particular, he
helped figure out how to create a new string and helped modularize
the code by creating a new function. He also helped fix and debug
our spacing issues.

The resources we used throughout this assignment is reading through
documentation for python modules.

The time spent doing this assignment is about 10-15 hours

This assignment was truly helpful in teaching me about SQL, this was
my first time learning about SQL and I think the assignment did
a great job at teaching me the basics of SQL and its syntaxes

David:
This assignment helped familiarize me with python program writing and testing,
as I have only had experince in python jupyter notebooks where testing is easy,
and composing a coherent larger program is harder. I think the assignment helped us
both to learn and understand the SQL procedure better than our previous knowledge, 
and helped me to understand the testing and debugging process after a semester and 
summer removed from doing that in COS 217
